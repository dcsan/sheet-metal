## Is this opensource?

[Yes](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheet-metal)

## Why use SheetMetal rather than Sheetsu?

In the past I used <a href="https://sheetsu.com" target="_blank">Sheetsu</a> and I am a big fan. However they significantly increased their prices and started adding a lot of functionality which I don't need. I respect that they are trying to build an enterprise around their product, but for the small amount of functionality I need I can't justify paying $33/month. So I developed Sheet Metal to provide the same functionality and I pledge to keep the following promises:

1. It will always be opensource so you can self-host.
2. After I have built a robust number of features and the product is stable, I will stop. No additional bloat, just the core functionality that is useful.
3. I will not raise the price above \$5 / month to make it widely accessible (unless I find that the hosting/API is costing more).
4. I will not provide personalised customer support, even if you are paying \$5 - I can't justify the time at that price. However if there are any bugs or serious problems then I will definitely fix them.

## Why does it cost so much?

It doesn't. But if you really can't afford $5/month just contact me and I'll give you a one-year subscription free of charge.

## I found a serious bug, can you fix it?

Sure, just create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheet-metal/issues/). Please make sure to check the open issues first to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

## How is this different from {other product}?

Probably: 

<ol type="a">
  <li>They haven't implemented OAuth so they require you to make your Google Sheet public. Or:</li>
  <li>It's not different. I made this a while back and subsquently then there have been similar products appearing.</li>
</ol>

## Why not use the Google API?

- The documentation is verbose
- Their libraries are complicated
- Sheet Metal provides some basic helper functions, such as bulk operations

## Can you implement {feature}?

If you have suggestions just [create an issue](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheet-metal/issues) on Github. Please make sure to check the open issues first to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.
