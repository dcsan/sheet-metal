title: 'POST: Create new rows'

Use a `POST` request to create a new row in your Google Sheet.

## The basics

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/TAB" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    rows: [
      { "COLUMN_1": "VALUE_1", "COLUMN_2": "VALUE_2" },
      { "COLUMN_1": "VALUE_3", "COLUMN_2": "VALUE_4" }
    ]
  }'
```

This will create 2 rows in `TAB`.

## Examples

Add a single row to sheet named "Employees". Note that the endpoint always expects an array.

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    rows: [{ "id": "1", "name": "Erlich Bachman", "gender": "male" }]
  }'
```

Add multiple rows to sheet named "Employees":

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    rows: [
      { "id": "1", "name": "Erlich Bachman", "gender": "male" },
      { "id": "2", "name": "Jian Yang", "gender": "not hotdog" }
    ]
  }'
```



## Options

## Returns

#### 201: Created

The rows that were created and the location range.

```json
{
  "values": [
    { "id": "5", "name": "Jared Dunn", "gender": "male" },
    { "id": "6", "name": "Jian Yang", "gender": "not hotdog" }
  ]
}
```

We do not return the cell range in the sheet, as this data may be incorrect if another client subsequently updates the sheet (for example, deleting a row).

#### 401: Unauthorized

The metal key was invalid.

#### 404: Not found

The tab you were looking for was not found.
