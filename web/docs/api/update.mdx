title: 'PATCH: Update rows'
---

Use a `PATCH` request to update rows in your Google Sheet.

To identify the row(s) you want to update you need to add /{column_name}/{value} to the API URL.
Then you need to pass JSON object with new values. Updates only rows where {column_name} match {value}.

## The basics

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/TAB?criteria=COLUMN_NAME.eq.COLUMN_VALUE" \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "SOME_COLUMN_NAME": "NEW_VALUE",
    "OTHER_COLUMN_NAME": "NEW_VALUE",
  }'
```

This will update all data in `TAB` where `COLUMN_NAME == COLUMN_VALUE`. For every row that matches the criteria,
it will update the columns `SOME_COLUMN_NAME` and `NEW_VALUE`.

## Examples

Update all rows from sheet "Employees" where value of "gender" is male", and set the gender to 'not hotdog':

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees?criteria=gender.eq.male" \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "gender": "not hotdog" 
  }'
```

Update all rows from sheet "Employees" where value of "id" is "1", and update the name, gender, and status:

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees?criteria=id.eq.1" \
  -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "name": "Erlich Bachman", 
    "gender": "male", 
    "status": "terminated" 
  }'
```


## Options

## Returns

#### 200: Success

The rows that were updated and the location range 

```json
{
  "values": [
    { "id": "5", "name": "Jared Dunn", "gender": "male" },
    { "id": "6", "name": "Jian Yang", "gender": "not hotdog" }
  ]
}
```

We do not return the cell range in the sheet, as this data may be incorrect if another client subsequently updates the sheet (for example, deleting a row).

#### 401: Unauthorized

The metal key was invalid.

#### 404: Not found

The tab you were looking for was not found.
