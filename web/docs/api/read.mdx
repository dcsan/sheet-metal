Use a `GET` request to read data from your Google Sheet.

## The basics

```bash
curl \
  https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/TAB
```

This will get all rows in `TAB`

## Examples

Get all rows from "Employees":

```bash
curl \
  https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees
```

Read first two rows from the "Employees" tab:

```bash
curl \
  https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees \
  -H "limit: 2"
```

Read the third row from sheet "Employees":

```bash
curl \
  https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees \
  -H "limit: 1" \
  -H "offset: 2"
```

Get all "Employees" who are male and still employed:

```bash
curl \
  https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees \
  -H 'criteria: [ "status=eq.EMPLOYED", "gender=eq.MALE" ]'
```
