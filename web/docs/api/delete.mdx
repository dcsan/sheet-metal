title: 'DELETE: Remove rows'
---

Use a `DELETE` request to remove rows from your sheet.

## The basics

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/TAB?criteria=COLUMN_NAME.eq.COLUMN_VALUE" \
  -X DELETE
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This will delete all rows in `TAB` where `COLUMN_NAME == COLUMN_VALUE`.

## Examples

DELETE all rows from sheet "Employees" where "id" is "1":

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees?criteria=id.eq.1" \
  -X DELETE
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Delete all rows from sheet "Employees" where column "gender" is "male" and column "status" is "terminated":

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees?criteria=gender.eq.male+status.eq.terminated" \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
