title: 'DELETE: Remove rows'
---

Use a `DELETE` request to remove rows from your sheet.

## The basics

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/TAB" \
  -X DELETE
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "criteria: ["COLUMN_NAME=eq.COLUMN_VALUE"]
  }'
```

This will delete all rows in `TAB` where `COLUMN_NAME == COLUMN_VALUE`.

## Examples

DELETE all rows from sheet "Employees" where "id" is "1":

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees" \
  -X DELETE
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "criteria: ["id=eq.1"]
  }'
```

Delete all rows from sheet "Employees" where column "name" is "Erlich Bachman" and column "status" is "TERMINATED":

```bash
curl "https://sheetmetal.io/api/v1/YOUR_METAL_KEY/Employees" \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "criteria": ["name=eq.Erlich Bachman", "status=eq.TERMINATED" ]
  }'
```
