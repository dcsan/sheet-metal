## What it is

Sheet Metal is useful if you want to use Google Sheets as a drop-in replacement for a database, without having to deploy your own server to communicate with it. Sheet Metal connects to any Google Sheet via OAuth and provides an easy-to-use Restful API.

## What it isn't

Sheet Metal aims to be small and easy to get started. Sheet Metal doesn't provide advanced functionality such as data relationships, indexing, or language-specific client libraries. 

## Features

- Simple and unbloated
- Good documentation
- Does one thing and does it well
- Opensource

## Benefits

- Build a backend without any servers
- Use Google Sheets as an interface for editing your data
- Get up and running in less than 1 minute


## Where it is

Sheet Metal is opensource and MIT licensed. Everything is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/kiwicopple/sheet-metal)
